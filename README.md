# C/C++ Project Builder
## Description
This project is a desktop application that was created using Python language for backend code, PyQT5 library and Qt Designer for the user interface.

**The main aim of the program** is to build C/C++ project by providing a directory containing the project instead of writing commands in cmd or using makefiles, the program builds the files in that folder using GCC tool chain and generates an .EXE file with the desired name.

## Main Features
The program provides the following features
* **Choose directory:** opens a file dialog to choose the folder containing the project C or C++ files _(the program identifies if it's a C or C++ project on its own)_.
* **Build:** builds the project after choosing its location using GCC toolchain.\
  _you may want to specify the name of the .EXE file before building_
 * **Show in folder:** opens the directory that contains the project in file explorer.
 * **Run output:** runs the .EXE file in cmd window if the build process is successful.

## Additional Features 
* **One file executable** the program can be run directly using `C_Cpp Builder.exe` file which is genearated using PyInstaller using the following command:
  ```
  py -m PyInstaller --windowed --noconsole --icon=logo.ico --onefile --upx-dir="The containing upx.exe" --add-data "logo.png:." --name="C_Cpp Builder" GUI.py
  ```
  > You can download upx which reduces the exe size from [This Link](https://upx.github.io/)
  
* **Help:** you can open the help page  `Github repository` by clicking on Help page from help menu or by using the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>
* There are also shorcuts for
  - **Build:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>
  - **Run output:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>
  - **Show in folder:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>
* **Naming the .EXE file:** from the input box which is initially set to **Output** you can write the file name following the windows naming policies _if you don't specify the .EXE name_ the file is named using default name **Output.exe**
* You can create a folder named **Include** inside your project folder where you put the .h files that you dont want to add their relative paths in code and the folder will be provided for the build tool automatically.\
$~$.\
├── Include \
$~~~~~~~$ ├── header1.h \
$~~~~~~~$    └── header2.h \
├── source1.c \
└── source2.c

## How to use
You can either: 
1. Run the `Gui.py` file using any python interpreter
  >Make sure you download `logo.png` in the same directory and that you have PyQt5 library installed
2. Use the `C_Cpp Builder.exe` which is created using PyInstaller

## Building a project
A guide to how to build a project using C/C++ Project Builder
1. You choose the folder containg the project you want to build by clicking **Choose Directory** 
2. You build the project by clicking **Build**
   then:
   * in case you choose a wrong directory or an empty one → error will be displayed in Build Result 
   * in case your project has compilation errors in code → error will be displayed in Error space where you can read it or copy it.
   * in case your project has no compilation errors and the build is complete, the **output.exe** file will be  created inside a folder called Build inside the project directory.
3. You can run the output of a successful build process by clicking **Run Ouput**
which runs the **output.exe** in a cmd window where you can try your program.


## Project Structure
This Project consists mainly of 3 files:
1. `Ui_Py.py`: which is generated by converting the .ui file from QT Designer to a python file which can be done using:
   ```
   pyuic5 -x file.ui -o file.py
   ```
  > which the `Gui.py`  file inherts from the class inside `Ui_Py.py`.

2. `Builder.py`: is considered the backend of the program which uses OS and subprocess modules to use command prompt to achieve the program purpose.
3. `Gui.py`: which is considered the main file that shows the application and interacts with the user. \
The file links each component in the ui to its function and does the functions required using `Builder.py` and displays the output to user using labels.
